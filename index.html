      Description: The File Organizer is a Python project that helps users sort
      and organize files in a specified directory. It automatically moves files
      into subfolders based on their file extensions, simplifying file
      management.
    </p>
    <p>Requirements: Python 3.x Standard libraries: os shutil</p>
    <p>
      Instructions to Run: Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. Save
      the index.py script on your machine. Run the Python script from the
      command line: python index.py Input the directory path to be organized
      when prompted. The script will create subfolders for each file type and
      move files accordingly.
